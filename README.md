# Multivariate Linear Regression using second-order optimizer L-BFGS
A comparison between the analytic approach and gradient descent using first- and second-order optimizers in PyTorch.

## Documentation
Have a look at my post on Medium titled: **Multivariate Linear Regression using second-order optimizer L-BFGS**

## Code
- Python version: tested with Python 3.12, but should run equally well with any version between 3.8 & 3.11
- Required packages: `requirements.txt`
