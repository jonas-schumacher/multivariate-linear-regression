# Multivariate Linear Regression using second-order optimizer L-BFGS
A comparison between the analytic approach and gradient descent using first- and second-order optimizers in PyTorch.

## Documentation
The best way to get started is by reading my story on Medium titled: 
[Multivariate Linear Regression using second-order optimizer L-BFGS](https://medium.com/@jonas.schumacher/multivariate-linear-regression-using-second-order-optimizer-l-bfgs-95ca229cd369).

## Code
- Python version: tested with Python 3.12, but should run equally well with any version between 3.8 & 3.11
- Required packages: `requirements.txt`
